* It is better than [Keyman](http://keyman.com/) on Windows, [KMFL](http://linux.lsdev.sil.org/wiki/index.php/Installing_KMFL_on_Ubuntu) on Linux or [Ukulele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele) on Mac.
* Using [Google Japanese Input](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/japaneseinput/eula.html?platform=win) currently, in the future it will use [Mozc](https://github.com/somiyagawa/mozc).

# 3 EgyptianHiero font

* Ligature function was made by Marwan Kilani
* Based on Mark-Jan Nederhof's New Gardiner font. 
* He permits us to use it, saying "The font is fully free for all private, academic and non-commercial use, including modification and redistribution. Acknowledgements where appropriate will of course be appreciated. "(https://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/egyptian/fonts/newgardiner.html)
* Please select all the letters, open the font window, and make all the ligature valid.

# 4 Ruby tools and Coptic Pop-Up Dictionary for Mac

* Made by [So Miyagawa](https://uni-goettingen.academia.edu/SoMiyagawa)
* Tools made in ruby etc. for So's work on Coptic and Ancient Egyptian Digital Humanities
* Feel free to use, but almost no documentation. 
* Also, I did a small contribution to recode_coptic.pl 
 * (https://github.com/somiyagawa/converters_perl/blob/master/recode_coptic.pl)
 * It's really useful to convert texts made in old ASCII Coptic fonts into Coptic Unicode.
 * you can convert these ASCII fonts: "Coptic", "CopticLS", "CMCL", "NagHamadi", "avva_shenouda", "low"
